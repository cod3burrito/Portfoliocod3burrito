## Check out the work by the resident Boi Wonder
This project was coded on Visual Studio Code on a PC running Windows 10. Formal launch date is yet to be determined.


Code elements were researched on W3 Schools and Stack Overflow as well as bootcamp course notes and kind guidance from peers. A special shout out to GitHub for a current CSS Reset sheet! URL for that is included in the code.
